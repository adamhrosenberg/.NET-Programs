Well. Here we are on the last day. Morale is low. Happiness is even lower. I'm really considering why I am not currently playing
battlefront and fallout 4 instead I've spent maybe 40 hours on this assignment and my game still looks terrible.
Haven't been able to scale or zoom correctly. Our player square is in the center of the screen and all the food
and players are drawn around it. 

Today we also added a planel to show up when the player dies so he can reconnect. 
We've added player stats after they die and found count and mass in the main game gui.

May the CS gods have mercy on my soul.

Fixing bugs and trail issues. Fixed removing of cubes. The problem was with how we were assigning the UID in the 
constructor. Whenever the cube was moving it was adding a new cube to the world. We started working on the split method.
In addition, we figured out how to correctly send the correct mouse position relative to where the cube is. 

11/14
We are drawing the cubes now but there is a trail of cubes behind. Cubes are
not being removed correctly. So far we've put about 25 hours into this.

DNS lookup now opperational. Current issue with connecting to localhost or any ip address of the local machine.
Can connect to servers on non local host machines.

11/11
got server to connect to ip addresses, 127.0.0.1 for localhost. Need to convert this over to DNS lookup.
